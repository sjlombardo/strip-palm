README for strip-conduit 0.1
----------------------------

This is a gnome-pilot conduit for Strip 0.6.  Sort of.  Currently,
it only works in copy_from_pilot mode, so it actually isn't a
conduit in the sense of actually synchronizing anything.  At this
point, all it does is take data from the 3 strip databases and
dump then directly to gdbm files.

This is done strictly for the purpose of building a desktop
utility for locally viewing/updating the strip database.  GDBM is
used because a quick google search turned up a port of GDBM
for Win32, which is an obvious next target.

The desktop application I anticipate will be done in 
wxWindows/wxGTK.  This leaves open the possibility of a Mac
port also, once wxMac catches up.

Anyway... to build this, there's a fair amount of stuff you'll
need.  You'll need gtk, pilot-link, gnome-libs, glade-libs,
all sorts of stuff.  I might recommend that you head to 
helix (http://www.helixcode.com) and get updated packages
there.  They have a cool automated updater for gnome related
packages, and everything here appears to work with it.  

With the Helix gnome desktop, configure, make and install the
strip-conduit package with a prefix of /usr:

./configure --prefix=/usr
make; make install

Once you've done that, you should be able to go into gnome control-
center -> Peripherals -> PalmPilot -> Conduits -> Strip and
check the 'enable' checkbox.
