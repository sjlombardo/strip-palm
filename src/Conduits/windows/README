Howdy.

If you are reading this, you are probably wondering how to make this
work.  

Good question.

Mostly, you should be able to get the GDBM libraries for win32 from
Roth consulting (http://www.roth.net/libs/gdbm) and stick it in your
libs path somewhere.

Once you have that, compile the source.  The project files are for
Visual Studio 6.0.  You might be able to make it work with mingw, or
cygwin, or whatever.  Try it.  Fix it.  Good luck & send patches.

There is no installer to make the resultant .DLL part of the sync
process... you'll have to use the sync manager tool (CondCfg.exe) that
comes with the conduit sdk to manually install the .DLL.

To do that, bring up CondCfg, hit "Add", and enter the following info:

Conduit Type:  Application
Conduit:  c:\path\to\stripcon.dll
Creator ID: SJLO
Directory: Strip
File: <blank>
Remote Database: <blank>
Name: <blank>
UserName: <blank>
Priority: 2
Information: <blank>
Class Name: <blank>
Class Path: <blank>

Hit Ok.

Go into "Custom" in the hotsync manager, and set the "Strip Conduit"
conduit to "Handheld overwrites desktop".

Sync.

You should see messages in your hotsync log saying something like:

Synchronized x records from StripAccounts-SJLO
Synchronized 1 records from StripPassword-SJLO
Synchronized x records from StripSystems-SJLO

That's a good sign.  You should be able to go into your palm directory 
(c:\palm\<username> for me) and see a folder called "strip".  Inside
should be three gdbm files with the strip accounts in them.

Obviously this is completely broken... there really should be record
flags along with the handheld records, including a "new" flag, an "updated"
flag, etc.  Not to mention a real installer program.  This is really nothing
more than a quick hack to get us started in a direction.  Not even 
necessarily the right direction, just a direction.  I really only wanted
some gdbm files with which to start on a desktop application.

Please help finish this.
