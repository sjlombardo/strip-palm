Strip (Secure Tool for Recalling Important Passwords) is a password 
and account manager for the Palm(T) Computing Platform. It was designed 
to fit the demanding needs of IT professionals, but it is useful for 
anyone who needs to remember passwords, pin numbers, alarm codes, 
or any other collection of ID/Key pairs.   

Strip uses strong encryption to safeguard your data.  Before any account 
information is stored to the palm's internal databases it is encrypted 
using the AES(Rinjdael) algorithms. Strip uses SHA-256 for key generation.

# GETTING STARTED  #
####################
If you are upgrading from a previous version of Strip please
read the README.upgrade file. Upgrades to Strip 2.0 are only possible from Strip 1.0.
Users of older versions should upgrade to 1.0 before insalling this version.
 
If this is the first time you are using Strip all you need to do to
get started is to install the Strip.prc file using the palm install tool.
The first time you tap the Strip icon on your palm you will be prompted to enter
a password. This will become the initial system password, however
this password can be changed at any later date.  Whenever you 
run Strip from that point on you will be prompted to enter your password.
DO NOT FORGET YOUR PASSWORD!!!! Once data is entered into Strip it is 
encrypted before it even touches the palm databases. If you forget your
password you are out of luck.
